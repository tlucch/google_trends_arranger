# GoogleTrendsArranger
The company where I work generates Markert Reports of Argentina, so one of the thing they do is analyze the Google Trends of differente argentinian brands. The problem is that Google Trends gives you a horrible .csv file (argentian regions spelled wrong because of unrecognized characters, all values in the same column, etc.), so every time a report needed to be done, each data had to be passed manually one by one from the .csv file to another excel file. Also, the latitude and longitude of each argentiean provicen had to be introduced manually into this new excel. In order to stop doing all this work this manually and wasting LOTS of time, I created a python programm that reads the .csv file and arranges the information needed into a new excel file.

I uploaded an example done with the google trends of Coca-Cola and Pepsi
